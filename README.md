# Intent-Recognition-Based-Control-System
My bachelor's thesis deals with the development and fabrication of a novel control system for a hybridpowered prosthetic arm. The documentation follows a chronological sequence of problem identification and solution, all the while providing scientific evidence to back each decision.Research gaps have been identified by performing an extensive literature review of existing technology and dealt with during the progression of the project. '

The repository contains the relevant code and plots related to the characterization of Force Sensitive Resistors and microcontroller code for servo based actuators for feedback driven loading and unloading of the Force Sensitive Resistors.
